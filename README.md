Project Title: Privacy and Ethical Considerations in Big Data Analytics

Project Description: This project explores public perceptions and concerns regarding privacy and ethical considerations in the era of Big Data Analytics (BDA). Using a quantitative research approach, the study investigates individuals' viewpoints on privacy issues, trust in online service providers, awareness of ethical considerations, and general attitudes towards BDA. The research involves a comprehensive survey distributed to a diverse population, with data analysis conducted using Python for statistical analytics and machine learning algorithms.

Research Objectives:

1. To assess public concerns about personal information collected by online platforms.
2. To understand the level of trust toward online service providers in the context of BDA.
3. To evaluate awareness of ethical considerations associated with BDA.
4. To gauge public opinion on privacy and ethical discourse in the digital age.
   
Dataset: The dataset comprises survey responses collected through an online questionnaire, providing insights into respondents' experiences and perceptions related to privacy and ethics in BDA.

Machine Learning Algorithms and Data Analytics were performed using Python.
